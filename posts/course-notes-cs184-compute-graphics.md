# Course notes: CS184 Computer Graphics
This is a post about my notes on learning the computer graphics course at CUHK-Shenzhen (where many of the materials are quite similar to those in CS184). The homepage for CS184 is at [here](https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/sp24). My assignment achievements:

- Assignment 1 Rasterizer: [page](https://zhangbaozhe.github.io/cal-cs184-p1-rasterizer-sp24/)
- Assignment 2 Mesh Edit: [page](https://zhangbaozhe.github.io/cal-cs184-p2-meshedit-sp24/)
- Assignment 3 Path Tracer: [page](https://zhangbaozhe.github.io/cal-cs184-p3-pathtracer-sp24/)
