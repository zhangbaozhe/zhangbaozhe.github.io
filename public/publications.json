      "excerpt": "This work presents CoNi-OA, an obstacle-avoidance add-on to CoNi-MPC that lets a UAV cooperate with a UGV without global state estimation. A single raw LiDAR frame is converted into a modulation matrix that tweaks the quadrotor's velocity, producing collision-free trajectories inside the UGV's non-inertial frame in < 5 ms. "
