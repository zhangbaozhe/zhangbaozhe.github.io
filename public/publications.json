      "excerpt": "Key words: UAV model in non-inertial reference frame and MPC control. This work presents a new UAV control method for cooperative multi-robot systems, focusing on leader-following, landing on moving bases, and relative motion tasks. Unlike traditional approaches, it operates directly in the target frame without motion assumptions."
